A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.

            Given that x = 5, the table below explains the comparison operators:

     
            ==	equal to	x == 8	false	
            x == 5	true	
            x == "5"	true	
            ===	equal value and equal type	x === 5	true	
            x === "5"	false	
            !=	not equal	x != 8	true	
            !==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
            x !== "5"	true	
            x !== 8	true	
            >	greater than	x > 8	false	
            <	less than	x < 8	true	
            >=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false	
            <=	less than or equal to	x <= 8	true
